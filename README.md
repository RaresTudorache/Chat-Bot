# chat-bot
This project was created by a team of 5 in the **Code for Good 2018** Hackathon organised by JPMorgan Chase & Co in Glasgow.
We built a chat bot called *TheraBot* for the *Health in Mind* charity (https://www.health-in-mind.org.uk) that aims to help people that land on their website to find information more easily.  
You can find the presentation slides in the repository.  

**Disclaimer**: This is just a demo. The full project is owned and kept in a private repository by JPMorgan Chase & Co.

We used bootstrap to design a basic presentation page.

### Health in Mind integration
Our proposed integration with their website is through a button we designed and added to the homepage of their website on the bottom right corner.
